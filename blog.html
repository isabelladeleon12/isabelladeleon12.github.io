							When I won the golden ticket to VMworld at the end of my summer internship with VMware, I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. I would be immersed among the best and brightest at one of the most important IT conferences in the world. However, I also knew I would miss quite a few crucial days of my second year of college, and I wanted to get the semester off to a good start. I ultimately concluded that if there was ever a good reason to skip school, this was it. Early Sunday morning, as I entered the vast, colorful, and overwhelming interiors of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, I knew I made the right decision. I immediately noticed the sheer caliber of the 23,000 attendees at the conference. Everyone I met was an important decision-maker in their sectors, who had the power of defining the future of IT in their hands. As an attendant with the title, “VMware intern”, I felt like a speck of dust. However, my feelings of insignificance quickly vanished as soon as I had the opportunity to meet and have insightful conversations with other attendants, including members from VMware’s impressive CIO team, a manager working directly under an Intel fellow, an IT Director at an accredited university, and a man who boasted 15 VMworlds under his belt. Despite their titles, each of them made me feel welcome. </p>

							The rich collection of activities, workshops, labs, demos, keynotes, and breakout sessions were never-ending. When I wasn’t in a workshop, I found myself returning to VMvillage, a beautifully-designed enclave widely known as the “heart of VMworld”. Its brightly-colored atmosphere was the perfect combination of relaxed yet inspirational and productive. The area included a line-up of VMware-specific booths, a drone-racing station, a wall of VMware’s patents and accomplishments in sustainability, and a slew of giant bean bags. I remember having the most fun at VMware {code}, where I attended MakerSpace sessions - one of which taught me how to program with Wavefront software to gather sensor metrics using VMware’s IoT products Pulse and Liota. </p>

							 On my last evening at VMWorld, I rested on on one of the big fluffy beanbags, thinking about going back to school and reflecting on my unique experience at the conference. I was able to listen to inspirational speeches by entrepreneurial skateboarders and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, learn from many of VMware’s partner and customer companies, and get hands-on experience with the technology itself. Attending VMworld opened my eyes not only to the fabulous VMware community but also to the diverse, exciting, and ever-changing world of IT. VMworld was an oasis of ideas and collaboration, forming the relationships of tomorrow. It was exciting to be in the center of it all, hearing announcements of acquisition, new partnerships, and features just as they were being released. I came into VMworld feeling small, and I left realizing that new possibilities truly do begin with me.
